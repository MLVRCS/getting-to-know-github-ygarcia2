<p> dog - a tamed predatory animal with nonretractable talons, a keen sense of scent, and a barking, howling, or whining vocal.</p>
<p> The dog is a companion mammal. A dog has sharp fangs that allow it to readily consume meat, four legs, two ears, two eyes, a tail, a mouth, and a snout. It is a very intelligent mammal that can be very helpful in capturing thieves. It sprints quickly, barks noisily, and assaults strangers. </p>
